# Use this file to add custom file paths to keep during upgrades.
#
# This file supports a simple syntax to configure a custom list of
# files to keep during system upgrade:
# 
# - absolute paths to files or directories to keep:
# e.g. "/etc/default/user-backup.txt"
# or, using wildcards: "/home/*/.ssh/"
#
# - prefixed paths with a "-" for configuration files to NOT keep:
# e.g. "-/etc/hostname"
#
# - comments, like this block, prefixed with #.
#
# Limitations:
# - Symlinks are not supported and will be ignored.
# - Do NOT keep ("-") has higher priority than keep. When both are
#   present, the file will not be kept, regardless of the order.
#
#
# By default, keep this very file during backups:
/etc/default/user-backup.txt
